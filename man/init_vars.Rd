\usage{
init_vars()
}
\description{
Reset the variables to the defaults used to load and generate another figure. These
variables can all be set / changed in the config file. Nothing is passed in or
returned as the function is simply resetting the working environments. The variables
that are reset can be changed by enabling 'Override' in a config file to keep a
persistent aesthetic across multiple figures without having to set everything in each
config file. This is also designed to facilitate rapid style changes across multiple figures
as the setting only needs to be edited in one config file and will be essentially
inhereted by all subsequent figures provided the 'Override' option is not explicitly set.
