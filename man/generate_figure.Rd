\usage{
generate_figure(
  location.dir,
  location.file,
  printPlot = FALSE,
  savePlot = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{location.dir}{The directory the data file is contained in}

\item{location.file}{The file containing the data}

\item{printPlot}{Should the finished plot be printed}

\item{savePlot}{Should the finished plot & log be saved to disk}
}
\description{
This is the main function that builds a plot based on the specified configuration file. Pass in
the desired directory and file name in string format. By default the function does not print the
resulting plot but does save the plot and a log file in the same directory where the configuration
file is located.

The configuration file must end in .txt and follow a specific format. The resulting plot and log
files both take the same name as the config file and simply changes the file extension. The plot
type is specified in the config file (default is .jpg) and the log file is set as .histova.

This function is a basic wrapper function for the following three main functions:
load_file()
run_data()
build_figure()
These can be run individually to the same effect. Functions are in development to allow editing and
setting of settings for use in developing what the finished figure will look like (e.g. color and fonts).
