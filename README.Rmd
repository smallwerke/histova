**NOTE: This is very much a work in progress. The current script appears functional but is in the process of going through extensive testing, documentation, and code cleanup. However the initial very basic test file worked. It is designed around the work I am doing routinely in a molecular biology lab and it might be of use to others.**

# histova

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of histova is to package a script that I am using to display a variety of data generated in a molecular biology lab (RT-qPCR, ELISA, protein quantification...) and enable the user to perform basic statistical tests on the data. Given that the desired layout and overall aesthetics of figures change depending on the audience (slide presentation vs. poster vs. paper etc.) *strange* custom features have been included to allow certain aesthetic settings to be defined in one **master** configuration file and essentially override all subsequent files allowing for batch application of formatting edits.

## Installation

You can install the development *aka* **UNCOMPLETE** version of histova from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("smallwerke/histova")
```

I will be adding example configuration files in the near future along with more detailed examples.

## Example

Basic use of the histova sript. Very simple process that generates a figure by specifying the source directory and the config file. The output figure is saved to the source directory.

All of the example config files are included in the extdata directory.

### Load Package

```{r exampleLoad}
library(histova)
library(stringr) # for the str_remove call
```

***The following examples are loading the final jpg figure that is produced. It is possible to have the package output a figure to RStudio for immediate examination though the font configuration is often incomplete.***

### One Group

The most basic version of this script is simply for building a histogram with only *one* group type defined out of the two that are possible. No statistics were run on this data and the individual data scatter is not being displayed.

```{r example1}
f = "test-1_group-basic_no_stats.txt"
d = stringr::str_remove(histova_example(f), paste0("/",f))
histova::generate_figure(d,f)
knitr::include_graphics("inst/extdata/test-1_group-basic_no_stats.jpg")
```
