```

**NOTE: This is very much a work in progress. The current script appears functional but is in the process of going through extensive testing, documentation, and code cleanup. However the initial very basic test file worked. It is designed around the work I am doing routinely in a molecular biology lab and it might be of use to others.**

# histova

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of histova is to package a script that I am using to display a variety of data generated in a molecular biology lab (RT-qPCR, ELISA, protein quantification...) and enable the user to perform basic statistical tests on the data. Given that the desired layout and overall aesthetics of figures change depending on the audience (slide presentation vs. poster vs. paper etc.) *strange* custom features have been included to allow certain aesthetic settings to be defined in one **master** configuration file and essentially override all subsequent files allowing for batch application of formatting edits.

## Installation

You can install the development *aka* **UNCOMPLETE** version of histova from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("smallwerke/histova")
```

I will be adding example configuration files in the near future along with more detailed examples.

## Example

*this is just the boilerplate text that RStudio dumps out... I'll edit this once there are actual examples to be had...*

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(histova)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
