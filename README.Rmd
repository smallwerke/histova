```

**NOTE: This is very much a work in progress. The current script appears functional but is in the process of going through extensive testing, documentation, and code cleanup. However the initial very basic test files are working. A few ggplot2 related warning messages still print during figure generation but the code is functional. I will be uploading additional example configuration files in the near future and adding documentation. The config header file DOES explain all of the existing options. It is designed around the work I am doing routinely in a molecular biology lab and it might be of use to others.** 

# histova

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of histova is to package a script that I am using to display a variety of data generated in a molecular biology lab (RT-qPCR, ELISA, protein quantification...) and enable the user to perform basic statistical tests on the data. Given that the desired layout and overall aesthetics of figures change depending on the audience (slide presentation vs. poster vs. paper etc.) *strange* custom features have been included to allow certain aesthetic settings to be defined in one **master** configuration file and essentially override all subsequent files allowing for batch application of formatting edits.

## Installation

You can install the development *aka* **UNCOMPLETE** version of histova from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("smallwerke/histova")
```

This version needs to undergo final testing but appears to be fully functioning at this time.

## Overview

I will be adding more example configuration files in the near future along with more detailed examples. The basic premise is that the figures are generated based off of a simple text file that controls the appearance, statistical tests, and holds the raw data. This is often pasted in from excel or directly from an instrument. The file is tab delimited with the configuration options at the head. 

The header lines all begin with `#` with `##` denoting a comment and `#` a configuration setting. The default values and typical options are detailed in the config header. Example files are in [inst/extdata](https://github.com/smallwerke/histova/tree/main/inst/extdata).

Data lines are in the format of value->group1->group2.

I am currently planning on writing a function that will generate a config file for you that just needs to have data appended to it.

## Example

Basic use of the histova sript. Very simple process that generates a figure by specifying the source directory and the config file. The output figure is saved to the source directory.

All of the example config files are included in the extdata directory.

### Load Package

```{r exampleLoad}
library(histova)
library(stringr) # for the str_remove call
```

***The following examples are loading the final jpg figure that is produced. It is possible to have the package output a figure to RStudio for immediate examination though the font configuration is often incomplete.***

### One Group

A rather basic 1 Group version of this script that does include individual data points and the results of a ANOVA test displayed as letters in the figure with a p < 0.05 used for significance.

```{r example1}
f = "test-1_group-ANOVA_scatter_outlier.txt"
d = stringr::str_remove(histova_example(f), paste0("/",f))
# running generate_figure with plot display & save turned off since readme 
# saves in a temporary location
histova::generate_figure(d,f, FALSE, FALSE)
knitr::include_graphics("inst/extdata/test-1_group-ANOVA_scatter_outlier.jpg")
```
